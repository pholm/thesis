\section{Problem statement}

\todo[inline]{zero hypothesis: WAs have no effect on CT}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[{\bf RQ1}] How do teams use Working Agreements?
    \item[{\bf RQ2}] How do Working Agreements influence team productivity?
\end{enumerate}

For RQ1, we examine the usage data of Swarmia teams. The aim is to find out how popular is the Working Agreements feature and how teams have configured it. 

We look into RQ2 from two aspects: Do Working Agreements overall influence team productivity and if they do, are some configurations of working agreements more influential than others.
