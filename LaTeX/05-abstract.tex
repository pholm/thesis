\textit{Introduction}: Effective team collaboration is essential for the success of software development projects. One key aspect of collaboration is ways of working, defined as explicit and implicit rules and norms that guide team behavior. Swarmia, a SaaS productivity tool, offers a Working Agreements feature to help teams set and track their ways of working based on version control and issue tracker data. There is little prior research on how teams utilize such tools and their impact on performance.

\textit{Methods}: The study used a quantitative research design and analyzed data from a sample of 422 Swarmia client teams. The research aimed to understand the relationship between how teams use Working Agreements and their software development performance. SQL and multiple linear regression were used for the analysis.

\textit{Results}: $64\%$ of teams configured four or fewer Working Agreements, with the most common being limits for pull request cycle and review times. Limiting the number of open pull requests increased cycle times while prohibiting main branch pushes and limiting review time decreased them. Each team member using Slack notifications reduced the PR cycle time by $2.5$ hours. Furthermore, using team-level Slack reports reduced the development times. Larger teams miss their targets more often but perform better in terms of PR cycle time.

\textit{Conclusion}: Multiple relationships were found between the Working Agreement configuration and cycle times. This study's findings can inform the development of productivity tools and strategies for improving team collaboration. More metrics and interviews would provide a better view of the teams' situation. Future research should focus on optimal Working Agreements for different teams, Slack notification optimization, and the impact of agreements that cannot be currently configured in Swarmia or similar tools.
