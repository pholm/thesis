\section{RQ1 results}

To get an overview on how teams are using Working Agreements, we started with the proportional popularity of WAs. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:waPopularity}, the agreements max\_pull\_request\_review\_time and max\_pull\_request\_age are the used the most, with over three hundred teams using them. Another atypical WA is min\_issue\_contributors, with approximately only 150 teams using.

\input{LaTeX/figures/popularity.tex}

A distribution of how many WAs each team has in use was calculated. The results are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:waDistribution}. Even though there exists eight Working Agreement templates, the number of WAs in use can exceed this: issue related agreements can be configured multiple times for a single team. For example, max\_issue\_age can be configured distinctly for epics, stories, tasks and bugs. Still, only a small share of teams have configured more than eight WAs.

\section{RQ2 results}

The main method used for RQ2 is the multiple linear regression model. The aim was to look into how Working Agreement configurations and other independent factors affect PRCT. 

The results are presented in Table \ref{tab:lmResults}. The values in "Iteration" columns represent weight of the variable in days. The asterisks denote significance at 10/5/1\% confidence level.

% another way of presenting linear model results, maybe better than the table. How to show p value here?Ã¥
%  metrics 9-11 are not boolean (amount of people), so they should be presented in other way.
